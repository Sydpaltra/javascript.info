<!-- Working with variables -->

<script> 
"use strict";

// 1. Declare two variables: admin and name.
let admin;
let name;
// 2. Assign the value "John" to name.
name = "John";
// 3. Copy the value from name to admin.
admin = name;
// 4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
alert(admin);
</script>

<!-- Giving the right name -->
<script>
"use strict";

// 1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
let ourPlant = "earth";
// 2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
let currentUser;
</script>

<!-- Uppercase const? -->
<script>
    "use strict";

// Examine the following code:

const birthday = '18.04.1982';

const age = someCode(birthday);

//Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant.
//The age is calculated from birthday using someCode(), which means a function call that we didn’t explain yet (we will soon!), but the details don’t matter here, the point is that age is calculated somehow based on the birthday.
//Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase? YES! Birthday is known before executing the script

const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase? -> NO! Age is not known before running the script. Also: Maybe age shouldn't be a const? It changes over time?

</script>
